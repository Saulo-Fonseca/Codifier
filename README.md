# Codifier
An Artificial Intelligence C Programmer

A compiled computer program is no more than the interpretation of a sequence of numbers by an electronic processor. What if we generated a sequence of random numbers and let them be interpreted? What if we used a genetic algorithm to modify the sequence so that, once interpreted, the program could solve a task? The following represents my efforts to chart one of the few remaining frontiers of artificial intelligence:  the creation of a program capable of creating another program. The Codifier algorithm receives two vectors of numbers, in the form of a source and a target, after which it presents a program in C language that transforms the source vector into the target.

Here you can find a paper describing my work and the source code of the project. Please compile it using C++11.

Compile on unix/linux systems by running "make".
